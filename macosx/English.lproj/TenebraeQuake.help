<BR>
This is a port of TenebraeQuake. TenebraeQuake adds bump-mapping and stencil-shadows to the original GLQuake. You shouldn't wonder if you receive a lower performance as with the standard GLQuake since this techniques are very GPU intensive. Furthermore TenebraeQuake will only work with recent GPUs, f.e. the ATI Rage128[Pro] won't do the job. For more information on TenebraeQuake visit &quot;<A HREF="http://users.pandora.be/hollemeersch/blackrose">http://users.pandora.be/hollemeersch/blackrose</A>&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Installation:</U></B><BR>
<BR>
Simply copy the &quot;TenebraeQuake&quot; applications to your harddrive. When you startup TenebraeQuake for the first time, you will be asked to locate the &quot;id1&quot; folder which comes with the shareware or full version of Quake.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Mission Packs/Mods:</U></B><BR>
<BR>
There are three ways to use mission packs/mods:<BR>
<BR>
Method one:<BR>
Simply drag the folder which contains the mission pack/mod onto the desired Quake application icon.<BR>
<BR>
Method two:<BR>
Rename the &quot;PAK&quot; file within the mission pack/mod folder to &quot;pak2.pak&quot; and move it from the mission pack/mod folder to the &quot;id1&quot; folder.<BR>
<BR>
Method three:<BR>
Start the desired Quake application from the command line with the &quot;-game&quot; option. For example: &quot;./Quake -game ROGUE&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Note: Mission packs/mods have to be installed at the same folder which contains the &quot;id1&quot; folder. If this isn't the case, you'll get a warning dialog, which tells you to change the location of  the mission pack folder.</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Mouse Speed:</U></B><BR>
<BR>
If the maximum mouse speed at the options dialog doesn't fit your needs, you should go to the Quake console and experiment with the variable &quot;sensitivity&quot;. Entering &quot;sensitivity&quot; without any parameter will report the current mouse speed value. Entering &quot;sensitivity x&quot;, f.e. &quot;sensitivity 44&quot;, will set the mouse speed to the value of x.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Known problems:</U></B><BR>
<BR>
[1.] This problem does only occur with MacOS X v10.1 or later: If you <B>insert</B> a new <B>Audio-CD</B> while the game is already running, <B>iTunes</B> will be started automatically in the background. iTunes will get the active application but will not be visible if you are in fullscreen mode. To gain back control over Quake you should hit the mouse button once or hit <command-tab> until controls are back. I already tried to implement deactivating the autostart, by setting &quot;AutoplayAudioCD&quot; within the finder defaults to zero, but this takes only effect after loging out/in again.<BR><BR><I>Workaround: Under MacOS X v10.1.x use the free utility &quot;<b>TinkerTool</B>&quot; to disable the autostart of iTunes. Under MacOS X v10.2 or later go the  &quot;CDs & DVDs &quot; System Preferences panel and set  &quot;When you insert a music CD &quot; to  &quot;ignore &quot;.</I><BR>
<BR>
[2.] If you get a <B>video mode</B>, which your monitor can't display upon the first start of Quake, you should edit the line &quot;_vid_default_mode x&quot; within the &quot;id1/config.cfg&quot; file and change the value of "x" until you get a working display mode. Mode &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; are windowed modes.<BR>
<BR>
[3.] If you used the <B>Classic RAVE</B> or <B>PC</B> version of Quake and want to use the MacOS X version of GLQuake/GLQuakeWorld, you should remove the &quot;glquake&quot; folder within the &quot;id1&quot; folder.<BR>
<BR>
[4.] The PAK files of the <B>MacSoft Quake Demo</B> version won't work.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Optimizing performance:</U></B><BR>
<BR>
[1.] <B>Quit</B> all other applications, since they will run in the background.<BR>
<BR>
[2.] Enabling <B>FSAA</B> will reduce performance.<BR>
<BR>
[3.] Enabling <B>Truform</B> via &quot;gl_truform&quot; will reduce performance.<BR>
